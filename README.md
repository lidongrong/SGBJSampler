# SGBJSampler

This repository provides the implementation of some of the sampler (optimizers) proposed in my academic research. Sampler is implemented in pure pytorch, which can directly be plugged-in to posterior sampling on complicated models such as Bayesian neural network (BNN).

No redundant parameter tuning required, just plug it in like you are using SGD or the Adam optimizer.
